# Creator Analytics Implementation Project

## Project Overview
This project extends the `my-mini-zora` miniapp to include a comprehensive analytics dashboard for tracking creator earnings across multiple platforms (Zora and Rodeo Club).

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. API Integration
- Created three API endpoints:
  - `/api/creator-earnings`: Fetches creator earnings data from Zora
  - `/api/rodeo-earnings`: Fetches creator earnings data from Rodeo Club
  - `/api/analytics`: Aggregates data from both platforms

### 2. Data Computations
- Implemented calculations for:
  - Total earnings across platforms
  - Average earnings per post/sale
  - Collector vs trader identification and counts
  - Time-series data preparation for charts

### 3. UI Components
- Created a new analytics page at `/analytics`
- Implemented UI components:
  - `StatCard`: Displays individual metrics
  - `EarningsChart`: Shows earnings over time
  - `CollectorTraderChart`: Shows collectors vs traders
  - `PlatformBreakdown`: Compares platform metrics
  - `Dashboard`: Main component for the analytics page

### 4. Testing
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Created unit tests for UI components
- Created integration tests for API endpoints
- Added test scripts to package.json

### 5. Documentation
- Created `ANALYTICS.md` with:
  - Feature overview
  - Usage instructions
  - API documentation
  - Component descriptions
  - Development guide

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js** for the application framework
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **Zora SDK** for Zora API integration
- **Jest & React Testing Library** for testing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Mock Data for Rodeo Club**: Used mock data due to lack of official API documentation
2. **Separate API Endpoints**: Created dedicated endpoints for each platform for better separation of concerns
3. **Flexible Time Frames**: Implemented daily/weekly/monthly views for better data analysis
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the dashboard works well on different screen sizes
5. **Testing First Approach**: Created comprehensive tests to ensure reliability

## Results
The analytics dashboard provides a powerful tool for creators to track their earnings across platforms, with features including:
- Total earnings tracking
- Collector vs trader analysis
- Time-based performance tracking
- Platform comparison
- Interactive data visualization

## Future Improvements
1. Integrate with actual Rodeo Club API when available
2. Add support for more platforms (Foundation, OpenSea, etc.)
3. Implement more advanced filtering options
4. Add data export functionality
5. Create email/notification system for regular reports
